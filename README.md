Data science dotfiles and installation scripts for Ubuntu 22.04, Emacs, and
fish. Mostly focused on R and related tools for now.

## Installation

In theory you can run these from the command line:

```sh
./install_packages.sh # install system packages
./.emacs # install emacs packages
./install_packages.R # install R packages
./install_dotfiles.sh # add symlinks to home folder
```
